## Description

The game board consists of sixteen "cards" arranged in a grid. The deck consists of eight distinct pairs of cards, each with different icons on one side. The cards are shuffled and arranged randomly on the grid with the icon side faced down. The goal is to match each card's icon with its pair. Click on a card to reveal the icon, remember its icon and continue flipping the other cards to locate the other matching icon. The game ends when all pairs are revealed. Keep track of one's progress by the star rating, number of moves, and time displayed on the score panel.

The project follows the guidelines of [Udacity Project Rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/591/view)
